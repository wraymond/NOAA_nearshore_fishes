# Understanding fish community composition across nearshore habitats in southeast Alaska

## Goal and Objectives
- Goal
  1.Understand how fish community composition differs across nearshore habitats in southeast Alaska

- Objectives
  1. Build a statistical model to relate community structure (multivariate) to habitat characteristics
  2. Build a statistical model to relate juvenile abundance of harvested species/groups (e.g. Salmonidae, Gadidae) to habitat characteristics.
